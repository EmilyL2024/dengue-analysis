### Code Description:
 - The code file in the folder contains three parts:
   
   - The first part is where the results of the research are generated into a table with information about training and testing datasets, their sensitivity, s
     specificity, PPV (positive predictive values), NPV (negative predictive values), and AUC (area under the curve) values.
     - The results include the in-sample performance of the model, which is training and testing the model on the same dataset, the generalizability of the model,
       which is to train the model on one dataset and test it on another, and the re-assessed performance of the model with age-restricted datasets, where training and testing data have the same age range
     - Each of the results described above is summarized in a separate table accordingly
    
  - The second part is visualization, which converts the table generated in the first part into graphs for better readability and easier interpretation of the results.

  - The third part is summarizing the statistics, including the range, mean, and median, of each dataset into a professionally formatted table for submission to the journal
